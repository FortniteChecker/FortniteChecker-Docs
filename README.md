Repo is a full user guide on how to use the bot.

[![Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/438672538831290369.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/438672538831290369)

## Getting Started

To add FortniteChecker to your own Discord server, click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=438672538831290369&scope=bot&permissions=8)

The bot needs certain permissions to carry out the commands available. If it doesnt have the following permissions the bot may not work correctly. Majority of problems I get is from people not giving the bot its needed permissions e.g `SEND MESSAGES`, bot cant respond without this permission.

FortniteChecker Needed Permissions:

`MANAGE ROLES` - Only necessary for the premium bot <br />
`MANAGE CHANNELS` - Needed for Dynamic Channels <br />
`KICK MEMBERS` - Needed to use the kick command <br />
`BAN MEMBERS` - Needed to use the ban command <br />
`MANAGE NICKNAMES` - Only necessary for the premium bot <br />
`READ TEXT & SEE VOICE` - Needed so it can respond to commands <br />
`SEND MESSAGES` - Needed to provide a response for commands <br />
`MANAGE MESSAGES` - Needed for clear command and other small commands <br />
`ATTACH FILES` - Needed for returning fortnite stats <br />
`READ MESSAGE HISTORY` - Needed to read messages and respond <br />
`ADD REACTIONS` - Needed for the poll command

If you don't want to have any hassle with Permissions just give it `ADMINISTRATOR`

If you do require any assistance with setup or have a problem with the bot please join the support server [here](https://discord.gg/CjyGwrJ) or message me on discord here ùïÆùñóùñéùñïùñïùñëùñä#1870.

## Premium Feature

In order to gain premium on the bot you must pay ¬£10 as a once off payment. Extra features such as custom commands for your server will vary in cost depending on what you want but we can sort something out.

### What do I get with premium?

There is a custom ranking system for fortnite implemented into the bot for premium users. You are able to rank the players in your discord by Wins or K/d, all depends on your preference.

Your also able to setup custom roles so users can give themselves the role rather than you having to hand out certain roles.

Alongside premium you can also suggest extra custom commands.
